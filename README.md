# A simple Tic Tac Toe game with a GUI interface using Tkinter.
This game uses  a 3x3 grid of buttons to represent the game board, and the current player is displayed in a label below the grid. When a button is clicked, the corresponding cell on the game board is marked with the current player's symbol ("X" or "O"), and the win conditions are checked. If a player wins or the game ends in a draw, a message box is displayed and the game board is reset.
You can customize this code to add more features, such as a score counter or player name inputs, as per your requirements.
